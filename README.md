Run the ApartmentManagement.py first as that is the Login page to the main page(There are 3 users- User1,User2,User3 and their passwords are PW1,PW2,PW3 respectively; These were hardcoded values)
To be honest if you just want to access the main page, run Supporter.py
There you can do all the database things there
If you don't have 'mysqlconnector' download that first, cause I'm using  MySQL to store the database
